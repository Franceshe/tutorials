[Intro to PyTorch on mobile]

Starting with PyTorch 1.3, you will be able to use PyTorch models that have
been serialized via TorchScript directly from within Android apps. This
tutorial will provide a simple example of:

* Loading a serialized PyTorch model into an Android app from Java
* Use the new PyTorch Java API to define a ``Tensor`` to be fed through the
  model

Status: mostly ready to fill in tutorial details once final links are received from Ivan.
