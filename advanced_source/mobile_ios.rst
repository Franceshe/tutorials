[Intro to PyTorch on mobile]

Starting with PyTorch 1.3, you will be able to use PyTorch models that have
been serialized via TorchScript directly from within iOS apps. This
tutorial will provide a simple example of:

* Loading a serialized PyTorch model into an iOS app from Swift

Key links:

* `GitHub repo for working iOS app:

* `Mobile OSS Guide:

Status: ready to fill in tutorial details once Tao updates the tutorial in the doc to use Swift.
